{"name":"MRF89 AT Module","tagline":"MiRa_Mod_868_v1.0","body":"### About MRF89 AT Module.\r\nThis module is based on the MRF89XA8 (868 MHz) or MRF89XA9 (915 MHz) RF module and MSP430FR5969 micro-controller from Texas Instruments.\r\nModule can be controlled over UART with AT commands. As the module takes many signal lines for communication, this interface makes possible to reduce the number of signal lines significantly and make the communication interface very easy and understandable.\r\n\r\nFirst version of the PCB is ready and is being manufactured for initial tests. After we have proved the designed module is working and you can make your own PCB or order it directly from the  [BreakMyBoard](www.breakmyboard.com) web page.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
